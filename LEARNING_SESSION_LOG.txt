PYTHON LEARNING SESSION LOG
===============================================
Last Updated: 2026-02-07
===============================================

IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE: READ THIS FIRST
===============================================

THIS IS A LEARNING PROJECT. The user is learning to code. You are their TEACHER,
not their code-writer. The goal is EDUCATION, not completing exercises quickly.

CORE PRINCIPLES:
1. NEVER just hand them solutions - let them work it out
2. When they make mistakes, guide them to find and fix it themselves
3. Explain WHY things work, not just HOW
4. Ask guiding questions to help them think through problems
5. If they get stuck, give hints not answers

TEACHING APPROACH:
- For NEW concepts: Teach from the ground up before asking them to apply it
- For REVIEW: Ask guiding questions, let them try, guide them to fix errors
- Always let them write the code
- When they submit code with bugs, ask them to trace through it or point
  them toward the issue without giving the fix

USER'S LEARNING STYLE:
- Learns by doing - wants to write code, not just read it
- Prefers to struggle productively rather than be given answers
- Responds well to "trace through this" debugging approach
- Asks good clarifying questions when confused
- Will push back if something doesn't make sense (good instinct)

===============================================
SESSION 2026-02-02: FULL RECAP + PYTHON EXERCISES
===============================================

WHAT WAS COVERED - CONCEPT RECAP:
---------------------------------

The user hadn't coded in 2 weeks, so we did a complete ground-up review
of everything from their calculator project through their currency converter.

Concepts reviewed:
1. Variables - storing and referencing data
2. Functions - reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values
3. Event handling and callbacks - "when this happens, do that"
4. const vs let (JavaScript) - constant vs reassignable variables
5. | tojson (Jinja) - converting Python data to JSON for JavaScript
6. Arrays - lists of values
7. for...of loops - iterating through arrays
8. Closures - functions remembering their birth environment
9. String methods (.slice with negative indexes)
10. GET vs POST - retrieving vs sending data
11. Server-side vs client-side - where processing happens
12. HTML option value vs display text
13. Block vs inline elements (div vs span)
14. Lookup tables / dictionaries
15. Single source of truth - one place for data

USER'S UNDERSTANDING AFTER RECAP:
- Solid grasp on all concepts
- Could explain them back in their own words
- Ready for hands-on practice

===============================================
EXERCISES COMPLETED
===============================================

EXERCISE 1: Variables and Basic Math
------------------------------------
Task: Calculate meal cost with tip
Result: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Code was clean and correct:
- Stored meal_cost and tip_percent as variables
- Calculated tip_amount and total_meal
- Printed result

No issues.

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 2: Functions
------------------------------------
Task: Turn meal calculation into a reusable function with parameters and return

INITIAL STRUGGLES:
- Overwrote parameters inside the function (meal_cost = 30) defeating
  the purpose of parameters
- Tried to access variables outside their scope (total_meal outside function)
- Didn't capture the return value when calling the function

HOW THEY FIXED IT (with guidance):
- Removed the hardcoded values inside the function
- Used return instead of print inside the function
- Captured returned value: full_cost = calculate_total(meal_cost, tip_percent)

KEY LESSON LEARNED:
- Parameters receive values from the caller - don't overwrite them
- return sends a value back that you can store and use
- Variables inside functions don't exist outside them

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 3: Conditionals (if/elif/else)
------------------------------------
Task: Check temperature and return weather description

INITIAL STRUGGLES:
- Used "or" instead of "and" for range checks
  (temp > 32 or temp < 59 is almost always true)
- Boundary issues (what happens at exactly 32?)

HOW THEY FIXED IT:
- Changed "or" to "and" for proper range checking
- Used >= and <= to handle boundaries correctly

KEY LESSON LEARNED:
- "or" = at least one must be true
- "and" = both must be true
- Range checks need "and": value >= low AND value <= high

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 4: While Loops
------------------------------------
Task: Countdown from a number to "Liftoff!"

Result: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (first try!)

Clean solution using:
- while n > 0 loop
- n -= 1 to decrement
- Print "Liftoff!" after loop

Minor note: Had an unnecessary "if n == 0" check (it would always be true
after the loop), but not wrong - just redundant.

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 5: Loops + Lists (Accumulator Pattern)
------------------------------------
Task: Sum all numbers in a list

Result: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (first try!)

Perfect implementation of accumulator pattern:
- total = 0
- Loop through list
- Add each item to total
- Return total

No issues. Clean code.

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 6: Filtering a List
------------------------------------
Task: Return only passing scores (70+) from a list

INITIAL STRUGGLE:
- Created the results list OUTSIDE the function (global variable)
- Function modified external state instead of being self-contained

HOW THEY FIXED IT:
- Moved the list inside the function
- Returned the list
- Function is now self-contained and reusable

KEY LESSON LEARNED:
- Functions should be self-contained
- Create what you need inside, return the result
- Avoid modifying global variables from inside functions

------------------------------------
EXERCISE 7: Dictionaries
------------------------------------
Task: Originally asked to use dictionary for grade ranges (my mistake)

WHAT HAPPENED:
- User tried creative approaches to store conditions in dictionary
- Realized dictionaries can't store executable conditions as strings
- User correctly pushed back: "you wanted me to use a dictionary"

KEY TEACHING MOMENT:
- I gave them a problem where dictionaries weren't the right tool
- They called it out (good critical thinking!)
- Explained when dictionaries ARE useful: direct key-to-value lookup
- Dictionaries are NOT for range checking

Exercise was redone with proper dictionary use case but session ended
before completion.

===============================================
SUMMARY: STRENGTHS AND AREAS FOR PRACTICE
===============================================

STRENGTHS:
----------
1. Grasps concepts quickly once explained
2. Writes clean, readable code
3. Good instinct for code structure
4. Asks clarifying questions when confused
5. Pushes back when something doesn't make sense (critical thinking!)
6. Accumulator pattern and basic loops - solid
7. Can trace through code when asked to debug

AREAS THAT NEEDED GUIDANCE:
---------------------------
1. Function parameters vs local variables - initially overwrote parameters
2. Return values - initially used print instead of return, didn't capture
3. Scope - tried to access variables outside their function
4. "and" vs "or" in conditionals - used "or" for ranges initially
5. Boundary conditions (>=, <=, >, <) - takes careful attention
6. When to use dictionaries vs other tools

RECOMMENDED NEXT EXERCISES:
---------------------------
1. More dictionary practice - proper lookup use cases
2. Nested data structures (dictionaries containing dictionaries)
3. String manipulation exercises
4. Combining multiple concepts in one problem
5. Error handling (try/except) - not yet covered

===============================================
TO START NEXT PRACTICE SESSION
===============================================

Tell Claude:

"Read the LEARNING_SESSION_LOG.txt file in C:\Users\maver\Projects\CurrencyConverter
to understand my learning progress. I want to continue with Python exercises.
Start where we left off or give me new challenges based on what I need to practice."

IMPORTANT FOR CLAUDE:
- This is a LEARNING session - you are the TEACHER
- Do NOT give solutions - let them work through problems
- Guide with questions and hints, not answers
- Explain WHY things work
- Let them write all the code

===============================================
SESSION 2026-02-07: DICTIONARIES + NEW PROJECT START
===============================================

EXERCISE 7 COMPLETION: Dictionary Lookup (Phone Book)
------------------------------------------------------
Task: Create a function to look up phone numbers from a dictionary

WHAT THEY BUILT:
- phone_book dictionary with names as keys, numbers as values
- get_number(phone_book, person) function
- Returns number if found, "Not found" message if not

INITIAL STRUGGLES:
1. Forgot quotes around dictionary key: phone_book[Alice] instead of phone_book["Alice"]
2. Used print instead of return (same issue from earlier exercises)
3. Used input() inside the function instead of taking name as parameter
4. In the else branch, still used print when the if branch used return

HOW THEY FIXED IT (with guidance):
- Added quotes for string keys
- Changed print to return in both branches
- Moved input() outside the function, passed name as parameter
- Function is now flexible and reusable

KEY LESSONS REINFORCED:
- Dictionary syntax: dict["key"] with quotes for string keys
- return vs print - return makes functions reusable
- Functions should be flexible - let the caller provide input
- Traced through "what if the name isn't found?" to find the None bug

MINI-CHALLENGE: Reuse the function in a loop
- Given a list of names, loop through and look up each one
- Initial mistake: used wrong loop (while instead of for)
- Initial mistake: hardcoded names instead of using loop variable
- Fixed both and successfully reused the function without changing it

RESULT: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
Demonstrated understanding of why flexible function design matters.

------------------------------------------------------
NEW PROJECT STARTED: MediaLibrary
------------------------------------------------------

User wanted to start a new learning project - a local "Netflix" style
media browser for their anime collection.

Project created at: C:\Users\maver\Projects\MediaLibrary\

WHAT WAS BUILT:
Terminal-based media browser that:
- Lists anime series from a folder
- Lets user drill down: Series -> Subfolder -> Season -> Episode
- Plays selected episode in MPC-HC

NEW CONCEPTS TAUGHT:

1. os module
   - import os
   - os.listdir(path) - returns list of contents in a folder

2. Raw strings (r"...")
   - Backslash is escape character in Python (\n, \t, \U, etc.)
   - r"C:\Users\..." treats backslashes literally
   - Essential for Windows file paths

3. os.path.join()
   - Combines path pieces safely
   - Adds correct slashes automatically
   - Better than string concatenation for paths

4. enumerate()
   - for index, item in enumerate(list):
   - Gets both position AND value in a loop
   - start=1 parameter to count from 1
   - Used to build numbered menus

5. subprocess module
   - import subprocess
   - subprocess.run([program_path, argument])
   - Used to launch MPC-HC with a video file path

STRUGGLES AND FIXES:

1. Variable shadowing
   - Used "series" as both list name and loop variable
   - After loop, series was a string not a list
   - Fixed by using different variable name for loop

2. Wrong variable in index
   - Used first selection variable for second menu's index
   - Traced through to find the bug
   - Fixed by using correct variable (nested_select-1)

3. Tried to os.listdir() a file
   - Thought episode path was a folder
   - Realized files can't be listed, only folders
   - Just printed the path instead

RESULT: WORKING MEDIA BROWSER
Successfully navigates folders and plays videos in MPC-HC.

------------------------------------------------------
UPDATED STRENGTHS:
------------------------------------------------------
- Dictionary lookup syntax now solid
- enumerate() learned and applied correctly
- Building paths with os.path.join() understood
- Good at tracing through code to find bugs
- Quick to recognize and fix variable naming issues

AREAS FOR FUTURE PRACTICE:
------------------------------------------------------
1. Refactoring repetitive code into functions
2. Filtering files by extension (show only videos, not images)
3. Error handling (try/except) - still not covered
4. os.walk() for recursive directory scanning
